## Introduction

Blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies are revolutionizing the financial world. Let's explore the key concepts and technologies behind this innovation.

## Blockchain Basics

1. Distributed Ledger Technology
2. Consensus Mechanisms
3. Smart Contracts
4. Cryptography

## Popular Cryptocurrencies

- Bitcoin (BTC)
- Ethereum (ETH)
- Cardano (ADA)
- Solana (SOL)

## Code Example: Simple Smart Contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract SimpleToken {
    string public name = "SimpleToken";
    string public symbol = "ST";
    uint256 public totalSupply = 1000000;
    mapping(address => uint256) public balanceOf;
    
    constructor() {
        balanceOf[msg.sender] = totalSupply;
    }
    
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success) {
        require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= _value);
        balanceOf[msg.sender] -= _value;
        balanceOf[_to] += _value;
        return true;
    }
}
```

## Key Concepts

- Mining and Proof of Work
- Proof of Stake
- Wallets and Keys
- Blockchain Networks

## Applications

- Decentralized Finance (DeFi)
- Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)
- Supply Chain Management
- Digital Identity
