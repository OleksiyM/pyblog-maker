## Introduction

Cloud computing has revolutionized how businesses deploy and scale their applications. Let's dive into the fundamentals of cloud computing and its key services.

## Cloud Service Models

1. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
2. Platform as a Service (PaaS)
3. Software as a Service (SaaS)
4. Function as a Service (FaaS)

## Major Cloud Providers

- Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- Microsoft Azure
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- IBM Cloud

## Code Example: AWS Lambda Function

```python
import json

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    # Parse the incoming event
    message = event.get('message', 'Hello from Lambda!')
    
    # Process the message
    response = {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': json.dumps({
            'message': message,
            'status': 'success'
        })
    }
    
    return response
```
