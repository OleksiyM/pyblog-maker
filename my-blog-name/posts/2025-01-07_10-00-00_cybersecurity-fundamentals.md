## Introduction

In today's digital age, cybersecurity is more important than ever. Let's explore essential security concepts and best practices for protecting digital assets.

## Common Security Threats

1. Malware and Ransomware
2. Phishing Attacks
3. SQL Injection
4. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
5. Man-in-the-Middle Attacks

## Security Best Practices

- Strong Password Policies
- Two-Factor Authentication
- Regular Security Audits
- Data Encryption
- Security Awareness Training

## Code Example: Basic Password Validation

```python
import re

def validate_password(password):
    if len(password) < 8:
        return False
    
    if not re.search(r'[A-Z]', password):
        return False
        
    if not re.search(r'[a-z]', password):
        return False
        
    if not re.search(r'[0-9]', password):
        return False
        
    if not re.search(r'[!@#$%^&*]', password):
        return False
        
    return True
```

## Essential Security Tools
