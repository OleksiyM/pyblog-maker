## Introduction

DevOps practices have transformed how teams develop, test, and deploy software. Let's explore the key principles and tools that make modern DevOps possible.

## Core DevOps Principles

1. Continuous Integration
2. Continuous Deployment
3. Infrastructure as Code
4. Monitoring and Logging
5. Collaboration

## Popular DevOps Tools

- Jenkins
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- Terraform
- Ansible

## Code Example: GitHub Actions Workflow

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: '3.9'
    
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -r requirements.txt
    
    - name: Run tests
      run: |
        python -m pytest
```

## Automation Strategies

- Test Automation
- Deployment Automation
- Infrastructure Automation

- Lead Time
- Mean Time to Recovery
- Change Failure Rate

## Getting Started

1. Choose Your Tools
2. Start Small
3. Automate One Process at a Time
4. Monitor and Improve

## Conclusion

DevOps is about culture as much as it is about tools. Success requires both technical excellence and team collaboration.
